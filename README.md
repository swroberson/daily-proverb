# daily-proverb
A shell script that prints out a randomly selected verse from the Proverb-of-the-day.

## About
The Bible's book of Proverbs contains 31 chapters, which, coincides pretty well with the number of days in a given month.  
  
I love to read the Bible. I have found that reading the Proverb-of-the-day is a very simple habit that has greatly enriched my life, 
so I made this simple package which prints a random verse from the Proverb corresponding to the current day:
